  <h1> Planting Roots, Controlling Sustenance, and Creating National Identity: The Story of the Uru Plant's Journey from Tahiti to Jamaica </h1>
        
          <p> This story map traces the production and consumption of uru (known to Europeans as "breadfruit") in the late 18th century. Uru is a subsistence crop; it is a fruit that becomes similar to bread when baked. British colonizers brought uru from Tahiti to the Caribbean islands to serve as a cheap food for enslaved people. The uru plant represents planting roots through colonization,controlling slave populations through food, and colonialism's role in building national identity. </p>

          <p> Note on the background map: This is a 1795 Mercator projection map of the world. It differs from many other maps in that Europe, Asia, and Africa are on the left and the Americas are on the right. This orientation makes it easier to visually represent the journey of uru from Tahiti in French Polynesia to the  Caribbean islands because the Pacific Ocean, where most of the voyage occured, is shown entirely. Many other maps show the trade between Europe, Africa and the Americas,  and thus show the Atlantic Ocean in its entirety and cut the Pacific Ocean in two. The map illustrates Captain James Cook’s routes through the Pacific from 1768 to 1779. </p>

        <p> My initial intent was to use the Carbonylser plug-in on Firefox to track my carbon emissions from this digital history project. Unfortunately, Firefox keeps crashing on my computer, so I do not have Carbonylser results for my project. As a substitute, I found the average of my classmates’ emissions for completing a similar project. On average, this project took 8,665 minutes and emitted carbon equivalent to 404 charged smartphones or driving 15 kilometers by car.</p> 

        <p> Our world is becoming increasingly digitized, and many people assume that going digital means smaller environment impact. We reduce paper by reading article online rather than printing them out, and we save ourselves a drive to the library by searching online databases, Before this project, I had never thought of the impact that internet browsing can have on the environment. I had also never considered how certain types of usage, such as downloading large files, can take up more energy than others. With this new information, I will be more mindful of how I use the internet. </p>

        <p> Beyond my personal usage, this has implications for how academia operates. Ethical and responsible academia requires scholars to be mindful of how their research impacts the environment, particularly when we consider how climate change disproportionately impacts already marginalized communities.</p>
